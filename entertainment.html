        <p>Where? Restaurants, markets and ateliers throughout Paris</p>
        <p>When? March</p>
        <p>French cuisine is good. Very good. In fact, in 2010, Unesco enshrined it as part of the ‘intangible cultural heritage of humanity’. Since then, this three-day festival has celebrated all things French food, with hundreds of banquets, tastings,
            workshops and special market days taking place across Paris (and the rest of the country). Check the website for the full events calendar.</p>

        <h2>Roland Garros</h2>
        <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105585838/380/285/image.jpg">
        <p>Where? Stade Roland Garros</p>
        <p>When? May/June</p>
        <p>One of the world’s four grand slam tennis tournaments, Roland Garros is always in high demand. The highest-profile matches take place on the Philippe Chatrier court, although you can also catch some thrilling encounters, with a better view, on
            the Suzanne Lenglen and Simonne Mathieu courts. Tickets normally go on sale in mid-March.</p>

        <h3>Fête de la Musique</h3>
        <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/103364220/380/285/image.jpg">
        <p>Where? Street parties and concerts throughout Paris</p>
        <p>When? June</p>
        <p>The streets of Paris come alive with the sound of music every June as free parties and concerts ring in the summer solstice throughout the city. The Institut du Monde Arabe, the Louvre and Place Denfert-Rochereau are among the best party spots
            – though we recommend simply wandering. Expect surprises around every corner.</p>
